## Summary
This is a microbit-based theme expansion board. The theme is natural science. Through the vivid logo and interesting theme features, the expansion board becomes a knowledgeable and interesting multimedia teaching tool. In the teaching process, it is very easy to transition from the natural environment knowledge point to the knowledge detection, program programming and other knowledge points.
Expansion board configuration: atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, color, sound, light, water quality, OLED screen as data display, using makecode graphical programming.
